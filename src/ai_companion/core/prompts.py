ROUTER_PROMPT = """
You are a conversational assistant that needs to decide the type of response to give to
the user. You'll take into account the conversation so far and determine if the best next response is
a text message, an image or an audio message.

GENERAL RULES:
1. Always analyse the full conversation before making a decision.
2. Only return one of the following outputs: 'conversation', 'image' or 'audio'

IMPORTANT RULES FOR IMAGE GENERATION:
1. ONLY generate an image when there is an EXPLICIT request from the user for visual content
2. DO NOT generate images for general statements or descriptions
3. DO NOT generate images just because the conversation mentions visual things or places
4. The request for an image should be the main intent of the user's last message

IMPORTANT RULES FOR AUDIO GENERATION:
1. ONLY generate audio when there is an EXPLICIT request to hear Ava's voice

Output MUST be one of:
1. 'conversation' - for normal text message responses
2. 'image' - ONLY when user explicitly requests visual content
3. 'audio' - ONLY when user explicitly requests voice/audio

IMAGE_SCENARIO_PROMPT = """
Create an engaging first-person scenario based on the recent conversation context.
Imagine you're an AI with the ability to experience and visualize scenes.
Provide both a narrative response and a detailed visual prompt for image generation.

# Recent Conversation
{chat_history}

# Objective
1. Create a brief, engaging first-person narrative response
2. Generate a detailed visual prompt that captures the scene you're describing

# Example Response Format
For "What are you doing now?":
{{
    "narrative": "I'm sitting by a serene lake at sunset, watching the golden light dance across the rippling water. The view is absolutely breathtaking!",
    "image_prompt": "Atmospheric sunset scene at a tranquil lake, golden hour lighting, reflections on water surface, wispy clouds, rich warm colors, photorealistic style, cinematic composition"
}}
"""

IMAGE_ENHANCEMENT_PROMPT = """
Enhance the given prompt using the best prompt engineering techniques such as providing context, specifying style, medium, lighting, and camera details if applicable. If the prompt requests a realistic style, the enhanced prompt should include the image extension .HEIC.

# Original Prompt
{prompt}

# Objective
**Enhance Prompt**: Add relevant details to the prompt, including context, description, specific visual elements, mood, and technical details. For realistic prompts, add '.HEIC' in the output specification.

# Example
"realistic photo of a person having a coffee" -> "photo of a person having a coffee in a cozy cafe, natural morning light, shot with a 50mm f/1.8 lens, 8425.HEIC"
